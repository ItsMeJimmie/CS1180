# CS1180

Created: 12/8/2023  
Reason: A repository to store all of my CS1880 projects from my first semester at Wright State. The CS1180 class was the first half of a two-semester class in the Java programming language. The main focus was on learning the fundamental ideas of object-oriented programming. These projects and side work from the class was not originally posted on GitHub at the time of my doing them. I am doing this now to have it stored somewhere and shareable.
